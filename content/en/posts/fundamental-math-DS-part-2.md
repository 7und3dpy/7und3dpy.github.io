# Basic Mathematics for Data Science (Part 2)

## 3) Linear Algebra

![](http://kisonecat.com/teaching/2014/math2568/logo.png)

Have you ever wondered how Facebook suggests friends or how Netflix always recommends movies tailored to your taste? These are examples of **recommendation systems** that use various algorithms to analyze user data and preferences in order to provide personalized suggestions.

Here, we will apply linear algebra to dive deeper into understanding how machine learning algorithms work with data streams. This knowledge is essential for data scientists to analyze and process data in great detail.

Let's explore the fundamental concepts of linear algebra that you need to understand:
- Basic properties of matrices and vectors: scalar multiplication, linear transformations, transposition, adjugate, etc.
- Matrix multiplication rules and various algorithms, matrix inversion.
- Special matrices: square matrices, ideas of sparse and dense matrices, unit vectors, symmetric matrices, identity matrices, and more.
- Matrix factorization techniques: LU decomposition, Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan elimination, solving linear equations (Ax = b).b
- Basis of vector spaces, orthogonality, least squares.
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors in matrices, diagonalization, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

#### How is this knowledge applied?

All neural network algorithms use linear algebra techniques to represent and manipulate network structures and train data. Linear algebra is also applied in image processing and real-world data manipulation.

Calculus is often a daunting subject for students studying in the fields of Science and Engineering as well as Economics. Nevertheless, no matter how intimidating it may seem, calculus plays a vital role in Machine Learning and Data Science.

Calculus is the foundation for fundamental analytical solutions, such as Linear Regression. Moreover, when building a machine learning algorithm to analyze and predict data hypotheses, calculus is crucial for finding the minimum error of the model and optimizing model accuracy.

These are some of the basic concepts you need to grasp:
- Knowledge of one-variable functions, limits, continuity, differentiation.
- Mean value theorems, different indeterminate forms, L'Hôpital's rule.
- Maximum and minimum values of functions.
- Product rule, Chain rule
- Taylor series, sum/integration of infinite series.
- Fundamental theorems and average value theorems of definite and indefinite integrals.
- Gamma and Beta functions.
- Knowledge of multivariable functions, limits, continuity, partial derivatives.
- Basic concepts of differential equations.

#### How is this knowledge applied?

Have you ever wondered how the Logistic Regression algorithm works? It uses a method called "Gradient Descent" to find the minimum loss function. To understand how it operates, you need to know concepts related to gradients, derivatives, function limits, and chain rules. By comprehending these, you can get a better grasp of how the algorithm works and can optimize it effectively.

Data Science nowadays relies heavily on computational systems, and Discrete Math is at the core of these systems.

Discrete Math includes vital concepts that are essential for everyday use of algorithms and data structures in analytical projects:
- Learning about counting principles, combinations, etc.
- Understanding basic proof techniques.
- Essential concepts of logic, induction, and propositions.
- Grasping basic data structures: stacks, queues, graphs, arrays, hash tables, trees.
- Fundamental graph concepts and applications.
- Recurrence relations

#### How is this knowledge applied?

For example, when analyzing social media user behavior, you can model the data as attributes in a graph structure. You might need to study the fastest algorithms to search and traverse nodes in a graph, which Discrete Math helps with. Understanding different complexities of algorithms for various spaces and times will aid you in selecting the appropriate algorithm for your problem.
